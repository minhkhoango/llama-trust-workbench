# Independent Auditors’ Report

# To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.:

# Opinion

We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“the Group”), expressed in Korean won, which comprise the consolidated statements of financial position as of December 31, 2024, and 2023 and the consolidated statements of profit or loss, comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and notes, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 and its consolidated financial performance and cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with Korean International Financial Reporting Standards (“Korean IFRS”).

# Basis for Opinion

We conducted our audits in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (“ISAs”) and Korean Standards on Auditing (“KSAs”). Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountant’s International Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (including International Independence Standards) (“IESBA Code”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements in the Republic of Korea, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the IESBA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

# Key Audit Matters

Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2024. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

# 1) Evaluation of commencement of depreciation related to construction in progress

The Group’s Device Solutions (DS) division is constructing factories for semiconductor production and begins depreciation of the production lines and equipment when they are available for use. Determining when the assets are available for use requires management’s judgment, and as explained in Note 2, Material Accounting Policies, the Group's assessment of when the production lines and equipment are available for use requires management’s subjective judgments on whether the assets are operating as intended.

We identified the evaluation of commencement of depreciation related to construction in progress as a key audit matter because the DS division’s investments are significant and if the commencement of depreciation is determined contrary to the substance, the impact of depreciation amount on the consolidated financial statements would be significant.

The primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter are as follows:

- Understanding of the Group’s accounting policies and the processes and internal controls applied to the evaluation of when the assets are available for use;
- Evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of the internal controls over the approval on commencement of depreciation related to construction in progress;
- Evaluating the design and implementation of the operating effectiveness of the internal controls regarding identification and monitoring of aged construction in progress;
- Inspecting documentation supporting the appropriateness of the commencement of depreciation of construction in progress during the year and subsequent to year-end on a sample basis; and
- Observing, on a sample basis, whether the Group’s construction in progress is in operation.

# 2) Sales deduction related to sales promotion activities

The Group’s Device eXperience (DX) division performs sales promotion activities, which includes providing price or volume discounts and incentives to customers including retail and telecommunication companies, based on explicit or implicit agreements. As disclosed in Note 2, Material Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Material Accounting Estimates and Assumptions, of the consolidated financial statements, the Group estimates the expected expenditures and discounts resulting from sales promotion activities at the time of revenue recognition and deducts the amount from revenue.

We identified the accuracy and completeness of sales deductions from promotional activities as a key audit matter because the calculation of sales deductions involves significant estimates and judgements by management and is subject to possible bias or error and the amount is material to the consolidated financial statements.

The primary audit procedures we performed to address this key audit matter are as follows:

- Evaluating the Group's accounting policies and understanding the processes and internal controls relating to the applied to sales deductions;
- Evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the approval of the sales deduction policy;
- Evaluating the design and testing the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction estimates and the approval of post-settlement adjustments;
- Evaluating the reasonableness of the estimates by inspecting, on a sample basis, the documentation supporting sales deductions estimates; and
- Evaluating the accuracy and completeness of sales deductions by comparing, on a sample basis, the period-end estimates to amounts settled subsequent to the period-end and examining relevant documentation.

# Other Matters

The procedures and practices utilized in the Republic of Korea to audit such consolidated financial statements may differ from those generally accepted and applied in other countries.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 have been translated into United States dollars solely for the convenience of the reader. We have audited the translation and, in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements expressed in Korean won have been translated into dollars on the basis set forth in Note 2.18 to the consolidated financial statements.

# Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated Financial Statements

Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.

# Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and KSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.

# Independent Auditors’ Report

As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and KSAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:

- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal controls.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditors’ report is Han, Sang Hyun.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.2 Changes in Accounting Policies and Disclosures

# (A) New and amended standards adopted by the Company

The Company applied the following amended standards for the first time for the annual reporting period commencing on January 1, 2024:

# Amendments to Korean IFRS 1001, Presentation of Financial Statements

The amendments to Korean-IFRS 1001 clarify that the classification of liabilities as current or non-current should be based on rights that are in existence at the end of the reporting period and that the classification is unaffected by management’s intentions or expectations about whether an entity will exercise its right to defer settlement of a liability. The amendments also introduce a definition of settlement to make clear that settlement includes the transfer to the counterparty of the entity's own equity instruments, however, it would be excluded if an option to settle the liability by the transfer of the entity’s own equity instruments is recognized separately from the liability as an equity component of a compound financial instrument. The adoption of the amendments does not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

# Amendments to Korean IFRS 1116, Leases

The amendments add requirements for the subsequent measurement of sale-and-leaseback transactions that are accounted for as sales in accordance with Korean IFRS 1115, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments require the seller-lessee to calculate the ‘lease payments’ or ‘revised lease payments’ in a way that does not result in the seller-lessee recognizing any gain or loss for the rights of use that the seller-lessee continues to retain after the lease commences. The adoption of the amendments does not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

# Amendments to Korean IFRS 1007, Statement of Cash Flows, and 1107, Financial Instruments: Presentation

The amendments to Korean IFRS 1007, Statement of Cash Flows, introduce new disclosures, such as terms and conditions, balance payment due dates and the effects on cash flows, to help users of the financial statements to assess the effects of supplier financing arrangements on an entity’s liabilities and cash flows. The amendments to Korean IFRS 1107, Financial Instruments: Presentation, requires disclosure of information about an entity’s exposure to concentrations of liquidity related to supplier financing arrangement. The adoption of the amendments does not have a significant impact on the Company’s separate financial statements.

# (B) New and amended standard not yet adopted by the Company

The amended accounting standard that has been issued but not yet effective for the annual reporting period commencing on January 1, 2024 and has not been early adopted by the Company is as follows:

# Amendments to Korean IFRS 1021, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates

The amendments to Korea IFRS 1021 clarify how the Company estimates a spot rate, which is used for translation of foreign transaction into functional currency or translation of foreign operation’s financial statements into reporting currency, when a currency lacks exchangeability. The amendments are applied for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2025, with early application permitted.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.3 Consolidation

The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with Korean IFRS 1110, Consolidated Financial Statements.

# (A) Non-controlling interests

Each component of profit or loss and other comprehensive income is attributable to the owners of the parent and the non-controlling interests, and total comprehensive income is attributable to the owners of the parent and the non-controlling interests, even if the non-controlling interests have a negative balance.

# (B) Elimination of intercompany transactions

Intercompany transactions, balances, income and expenses and unrealized gains and losses (excluding foreign exchange gains and losses) are eliminated on consolidation. The Company’s share of unrealized losses on transactions with associates accounted for using the equity method are eliminated in the same way as unrealized gains unless there is evidence of impairment of the asset.

# 2.4 Functional and Presentation Currency

# (A) Functional and presentation currency

The Company measures the items included in the financial statements of each component using the currency of the primary economic environment in which each it operates (“functional currency”). The functional currency of the parent company is Korean won (KRW) and the consolidated financial statements are presented in Korean won (KRW).

# (B) Translation into the presentation currency

The results and financial position of all entities subjected to consolidation that have a functional currency different from the parent’s presentation currency are translated into the parent’s presentation currency as follows:

1. Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting date.
2. Income and expenses in the statement of profit or loss are translated at average exchange rates for the period. However, if this average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions, the transactions are translated at the exchange rates at the dates of transactions.
3. Exchange differences arising on translation in (1) and (2) above are recognized in other comprehensive income.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.5 Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with banks, and highly liquid short-term investment assets that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash at the date of acquisition and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.

# 2.6 Financial Assets

# (A) Classification

Financial instruments are classified based on the business model for managing the financial assets and the contractual cash flow characteristics of the financial asset. The Company considers the contractual terms of the relevant financial instrument and assesses whether the contractual cash flows consist solely of payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.

# (B) Impairment

The Company assesses the expected credit losses of debt instruments carried at amortized cost or fair value through other comprehensive income on a forward-looking basis. However, the Company applies the simplified approach for trade receivables, which requires expected credit losses to be recognized over the life of the receivable from initial recognition.

# 2.7 Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are recognized at initial transaction price, unless they contain a significant financing component, and are subsequently measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method less any allowance for impairment.

# 2.8 Inventories

The Company determines the unit cost of inventories, except for materials in transit, using the average cost method. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labor, other direct costs and related production overheads based on normal operating capacity, excluding the cost of idle production equipment and scrapping costs.

The Company measures inventories at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the applicable variable selling expenses, and reflects the decrease in selling price, the increase in costs to completion, or decrease in value due to excess or obsolete inventory.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.9 Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation of property, plant and equipment begins when assets are considered by management to be available for their intended use, such as in the production of products.

The Company’s property, plant and equipment is depreciated on a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, less any residual values. Land is not depreciated. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction of a qualifying asset, including capitalized interest costs, are depreciated over the estimated useful lives.

|                          |              | Estimated useful lives |
| ------------------------ | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| Buildings and structures | 15, 30 years |                        |
| Machinery and equipment  | 5 years      |                        |
| Other                    | 5 years      |                        |

# 2.10 Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, businesses and other entities acquired at the date of acquisition and is recognized as an intangible assets in respect of acquisitions of businesses of subsidiaries and as an investment in associates and joint ventures in respect of acquisitions of interests in associates and joint ventures.

Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are initially recognized at their historical cost and are subsequently stated at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.

Membership rights are regarded as intangible assets with indefinite useful life and not amortized as there are no foreseeable restrictions on their use. However, whenever there is an indication of impairment, such as a decline in the market value of membership rights, a reasonable estimate is made to reflect the impairment. Intangible assets with finite useful lives, such as patents, trademarks and other intangible assets, are amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.

|                                                 |   |   |   |   | Estimated useful lives |
| ----------------------------------------------- | - | - | - | - | ---------------------- |
| Patents, trademarks and other intangible assets |   |   |   |   | 3 - 25 years           |

# 2.11 Financial Liabilities

The Company classifies financial liabilities into financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and other financial liabilities and recognizes them on the consolidated statement of financial position when the Company becomes a party to a contract, depending on the substance of the contractual terms.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.12 Employee Benefits

The Company operates various types of post-employment benefit plans, including defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans. The defined benefit liability (asset) recognized in the consolidated statement of financial position in respect of defined benefit plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets, less any deficit (excess of plan assets over the asset recognition threshold) and is calculated annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit credit method.

# 2.13 Income Tax Expense

The global minimum top-up tax in accordance with the Pilar Two tax legislation is subject to Korean IFRS 1012, Corporate Income Tax. The Company accounts for the amount of global minimum top-up tax as a current tax when it is incurred, and applies the exception for the recognition and disclosure of deferred income tax related to the global minimum top-up tax.

The Company recognizes deferred tax liabilities for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences arising on these assets only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilized.

# 2.14 Derivative Instruments

The Company recognizes its rights and obligations under derivative contracts as assets and liabilities at fair value and records gains and losses on these contracts in the statement of profit or loss. However, effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.

The Company applies cash flow hedge accounting for hedges of risks including changes in the price of inventories. The effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognized in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognized in ‘financial income’ or ‘financial expense’.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 2.15 Revenue Recognition

The Company’s revenue primarily represents the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the Company’s activities. Revenue is net of value-added tax, returns, sales incentives, discounts and others.

# (A) Identification of performance obligations

The Company is required to transfer control of goods and services under contracts with customers. For the export of products and goods under Incoterms Group C terms (such as CIF), the Company recognizes the transportation services (including insurance) provided after the control of the goods has passed to the customer as a separate performance obligation.

# (B) Performance obligations satisfied at a point of time

The Company’s revenue is primarily derived from the sale of goods and is recognized when control of the goods passes to the customer.

# (C) Performance obligations satisfied over time

The Company recognizes revenue over time for sales of software, transportation services, installation services, and etc. where the customer has direct control over the outcome during the performance of the service.

# (D) Variable consideration

The Company provides a variety of sales promotions including incentives, promotion and sales allowances. Where these sales promotion policies result in variability in the consideration promised to customers, the Company estimates the variable consideration using either the expected value or the most likely amount whichever method the Company expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. The estimate of variable consideration is included in transaction price only to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant portion of the cumulative revenue already recognized will not be reversed when the related uncertainties are resolved. Revenue and contract liabilities are recognized when the related revenue is earned or when the decision to pay the variable consideration to the customer is made, whichever is later.

The Company recognizes contract liabilities (refund liabilities) after the sale of products to customers by estimating the return rate using the expected value methods based on historical experience. When the customer exercises its right to return the product, the Company recognizes the asset as a refund asset and adjusts cost of sales by the amount of the right to collect the product from the customer. The right to collect the product is measured by deducting the cost of collecting the product from the historical carrying amount of the product.

# 2.16 Leases

# (A) Lessee accounting

The Company applies the practical expedient of Korean IFRS 1116, Leases, and does not separate the non-lease elements from the lease elements and accounts for the non-lease elements relating to each lease element as a single lease element.

At the commencement date of a lease, the Company recognizes a right-of-use asset (the lease asset) representing the right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing the obligation to make lease payments. The right-of-use asset is presented in the consolidated statement of financial position as ‘property, plant and equipment’ and the lease liability is presented as ‘current portion of long-term liabilities’ or ‘long-term borrowings.’

Lease liabilities are measured at the inception of the lease at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at that date, discounted at the Company’s incremental borrowing rate.

For short-term leases (lease terms of 12 months or less at the inception of the lease) and low value assets (underlying assets of USD 5,000 or less), lease payments are recognized as expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term applying the simplified practical expedient.

# (B) Lessor accounting

The Company, as a lessor, determines whether a lease is a finance or an operating lease at the inception of the lease.

Leases that transfer substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases and all leases other than finance leases are classified as operating leases. Lease income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while initial direct costs incurred during the negotiation and contracting phase of an operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and expensed over the lease term against the lease income.

# 2.17 Government Grants

Government grants relating to revenues are deferred and recognized in the consolidated statement of profit or loss in the same period in which they are matched with revenues or expenses related to the purpose for which the grant was made. Government grants received related to the acquisition of assets are treated as deferred income and credited to the consolidated statement of profit or loss over the useful lives of the related assets.

# 2.18 Convenience Translation into United States Dollar Amounts

The US dollar amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements represent supplementary information solely for the convenience of the reader. All Korean won amounts are expressed in US dollar at the rate of W1,363.09 to $1, the average exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2024. Such presentation is not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and should not be construed as a representation that the Korean won amounts shown could be readily converted, realized or settled in US dollars at this or any other rate.

# 2.19 Approval of the Consolidated Financial Statements

The consolidated financial statements of the Company were approved by the Board of Directors on January 31, 2025, and may be approved as amended at the Annual General Shareholders’ Meetings.

# 3. Material Accounting Estimates and Assumptions

The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and future events that are reasonably foreseeable under the circumstances. These estimates may differ from actual results. The estimates and assumptions that have the most significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the next financial year are as follows.

# (A) Revenue recognition

The Company recognizes a liability for a product return and a right to the returned goods that are expected to be returned by customers following the sale of products to customers. At the point of sale, the Company estimates the return using the expected value method based on accumulated experience at the portfolio level and the Company’s revenue is affected by changes in the expected return.

Revenue from the sale of goods recognized at the point of transfer of control is the contractual consideration less consideration paid to customers in relation to certain sales promotion activities. Based on the historical experience and terms of contracts, the Company makes reasonable estimates of the sales deductions which affect the Company’s revenue.

# (B) Provision for warranty

The Company provides warranties for products sold. At the end of each reporting period, the Company recognizes a provision for warranties based on its best estimate of the amount it believes is necessary to provide for future and current warranty obligations. These best estimates are based on historical experience.

# (C) Fair value of financial instruments

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using various valuation techniques and assumptions based on market conditions prevailing at the end of each reporting period.

# (D) Impairment of financial assets

In measuring the allowance for impairment losses on financial assets, the Company makes assumptions about the risk of default and expected credit rates. In making these assumptions and selecting the inputs for the impairment calculations, the Company makes judgment based on past experience and current and forecast of future economic conditions at the reporting date.

# (E) Lease

In determining the lease term, the Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances that provide an economic incentive to exercise a renewal option, or not to exercise a termination option. The period covered by the renewal option (or the period covered by the termination option) is included in the lease term only if it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise (or not exercise) the renewal option.

The lease term is reassessed when the option is actually exercised (or not exercised) or when the Company becomes committed to exercise (or not exercise) the option. The Company only changes its assessment of whether it is reasonably certain the renewal option will be exercised (or not) if there is a significant event or change in circumstances within the lessee’s control that affects the calculation of the lease term.

# (F) Net defined benefit liabilities (assets)

The net defined benefit liabilities (assets) are dependent on a number of factors which are determined using actuarial methods based on a number of assumptions. Among the assumptions used to determine the net defined benefit liabilities (assets) is the discount rate, and changes in these assumptions will affect the carrying amount of the net defined benefit liability (asset). At the end of each year the Company determines an appropriate discount rate, taking into account the interest rates on high-quality corporate bonds, which represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of the estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the net defined benefit liability (asset). Some other key assumptions relating to the net defined benefit liability (asset) are based on current market conditions.

# (G) Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful life

The Company tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful life for impairment annually. The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit or asset, including goodwill, is determined based on a value-in-use calculation. These calculations are based on estimates.

# (H) Income taxes

Income taxes on the Company’s taxable income are calculated by applying tax laws and decisions of tax authorities in various countries, and, therefore, there is uncertainty in determining the final tax effect. The Company has recognized current and deferred tax based on its best estimate of the tax consequences expected to be payable in future periods as a result of the Company’s operating activities up to the reporting date. However, the actual future final tax liability may not be consistent with the related assets and liabilities recognized, and such differences may affect the current and deferred tax assets and liabilities when the final tax effect is determined.

The Company is subject to additional income taxes, calculated in accordance with the method prescribed by tax laws, when a certain amount is not used for investment, wage growth, etcetera, in a given period. The related tax effect is reflected in the measurement of current and deferred income taxes for the period, and the amount of income tax payable by the Company depends on the level of investment, wage growth, etcetera in each year, resulting in uncertainty in determining the final tax effects.

The Company assesses uncertainty over its tax positions and, if the Company concludes that it is not probably that the tax authorities will accept an uncertain tax position, the effect of the uncertainty is recognized in the consolidated financial statements for each uncertain tax position using the method that is expected to provide a better estimate of the resolution of the uncertainty, which is more likely of the following methods.

1. Most likely amount: the single most probable amount within a range of possible outcomes.
2. Expected value: the sum of the probability-weighted amounts in a range of possible outcomes.

# (G) Other matters

(1) On July 12, 2018, the Korea Securities and Futures Commission determined an initial measure following an investigation relating to Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd., an associate of the Company, and its accounting for its investment in Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd, a joint venture between Biogen Therapeutics Inc. and Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. This measure included a recommendation to dismiss the director in charge, prosecution charges, and external auditor designation by the regulator, on the basis that the Joint Venture Agreement was not disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. On November 14, 2018, the Korea Securities and Futures Commission determined a second measure which included a penalty of W 8,000 million, a recommendation to dismiss the CEO, a requirement to restate its financial statements, and further prosecution charges.

To prove justification of its accounting treatment, Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. filed a suit for cancellation of the aforementioned measures to the Seoul Administrative Court, which is currently in progress. On September 24, 2020, the Seoul Administrative Court announced a decision to cancel the first measure charged by the Korea Securities and Futures Commission and suspended its execution until the final rulings of the appeal. On October 16, 2020, the Korea Securities and Futures Commission appealed the decision and the litigation is in progress at Seoul High Court. On August 14, 2024, Seoul Administrative Court announced a decision to cancel the second measure charged by the Korea Securities and Futures Commission, but on August 28, 2024, the Korea Securities and Futures Commission appealed the decision and the litigation is in progress at Seoul High Court.

Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. also filed for suspending the execution of the initial and second measures. On January 22, 2019 and February 19, 2019, the Seoul Administrative Court pronounced decisions to suspend the second and initial measures, respectively, until the final rulings. The Korea Securities and Futures Commission immediately appealed against the decisions but the appeals were dismissed by the Seoul High Court on May 13, 2019 and May 24, 2019, in relation to the second and first measures, respectively. On May 23, 2019 and June 10, 2019, the Korea Securities and Futures Commission re-appealed against the dismissals relating to the second and first measures, respectively. On September 6, 2019 and October 11, 2019, the Supreme Court of Korea dismissed the Korea Securities and Futures Commission’s re-appeal relating to the second and first measures, respectively, and confirmed the decision to suspend the execution of these measures.

Although the future outcome of the administrative litigation cannot be estimated, should Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. be required to restate its financial statements to amend its historical accounting treatment relating to its investment in Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd., the Company’s share of profit or loss relating to its equity method investment, the amount of investment in associates, and retained earnings, for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2022, and the profit on disposal of investment for the year ended December 31, 2016, may be impacted. Given the timing of completion and the final result of the administrative litigation between Samsung Biologics Co., Ltd. and the Korea Securities and Futures Commission is uncertain and cannot currently be estimated, it is not possible for the Company to recognize the effects of these proceedings in the consolidated financial statements of the current period.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually and the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit is determined based on value-in-use calculations. The value-in-use calculation is based on estimates of pre-tax cash flows based on financial budgets approved by management for the next five years (or longer if the medium and long-term plans are reasonable, such as in new technology business). A constant growth rate assumption (but not exceeding the industry average growth rate) has been used to calculate the perpetual cash flows for periods beyond the five-year period.

# (E) Global minimum top-up tax

The Company is required to pay additional tax for the difference between global minimum top-up tax rate of 15% and GloBE effective tax rate of each country where its constituent companies are domiciled in accordance with the Pilar Two. As Vietnam’s GloBE effective tax rate is less than 15% and Qualified Domestic Minimum Top-up Tax (QDMTT) comes into effect, the Company recognizes the Pilar Two corporate income tax as current tax expense, while subsidiaries in other countries are expected to have no or minimal impact under the Pilar Two. The Company has applied the temporary exemption for recognition and disclosure of the relevant deferred tax assets (liabilities).

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# 28. Financial Risk Management

The Company manages its financial risks with a focus on minimizing market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and others arising from its operating activities. To this end, the Company closely monitors and responds to each risk factor.

The Company establishes global financial management standards and manages the risks by periodically measuring customer’s and counterparties’ financial risk, applying currency hedges, and reviewing cash flows.

The Company also manages foreign exchange risk by monitoring foreign exchange rate fluctuations through local financial centers in the major regions (United States, United Kingdom, Singapore, China, Brazil, and Russia), which act as an agent for the subsidiaries in each region to manage foreign exchange transactions. In addition, local finance centers in the major regions respond to liquidity risk through a regionally integrated financial structure.

The Company’s financial assets subject to financial risk management consist of cash and cash equivalents, short-term financial instruments, financial assets at amortized cost, trade receivables and others, while its financial liabilities consist of trade payables, borrowings, and others.

# (A) Market risk

# (1) Foreign exchange risk

The Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from its global operations through transactions in currencies other than its functional currency. The main currencies in which the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk are the US dollar and European Euro.

The Company focuses on minimizing the impact of foreign exchange fluctuation by matching levels of assets and liabilities denominated in each foreign currency. To minimize exchange position, the Company’s foreign exchange management policy requires normal business transactions, including import and export, as well as financing transactions such as depositing and borrowing, to be in local currency or match as closely as possible cash inflows and outflows incurred in the respective foreign currencies. This reduces but does not eliminate the foreign exchange risk to which the Company is exposed. Moreover, the Company periodically evaluates and monitors the foreign exchange risk to efficiently mitigate such risk, and the speculative foreign exchange transactions are strictly prohibited.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the impact on profit or loss (before tax) of a 5% change in exchange rates on the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities denominated in a major foreign currency other than the functional currency would be as follows:

| (In millions of Korean won) | December 31, 2024 |           | December 31, 2023 |           |
| --------------------------- | :---------------: | :-------: | ----------------- | --------- |

| USD                         |      365,273      | (365,273) | 418,776           | (418,776) |
| EUR                         |       88,649      |  (88,649) | 151,740           | (151,740) |

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

# (2) Interest rate risk

Interest rate risk for floating interest rate financial instruments can be defined as the risk of changes in the fair value of components of the statements of financial position due to changes in the market interest rates, and the risk of changes in the future cash flows of interest income and expenses arising from investing and financing activities. The Company’s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from interest-bearing deposits and floating interest rate debt obligations, and the Company manages its exposure to interest rate risk to minimize uncertainty and cost of financing resulting from changes in interest rates.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the effect on profit or loss before tax of a 1%p change in interest rates on the Company’s variable rate financial assets and liabilities at the reporting date would have been as follows:

| (In millions of Korean won) | December 31, 2024 |           | December 31, 2023 |           |   |   |
| --------------------------- | ----------------- | --------- | ----------------- | --------- | - | - |
| Increase                    |                   | Decrease  | Increase          | Decrease  |   |   |
| Financial assets            | 141,671           | (141,671) | 210,617           | (210,617) |   |   |
| Financial liabilities       | (5,702)           | 5,702     | (6,197)           | 6,197     |   |   |
| Net effect                  | 135,969           | (135,969) | 204,420           | (204,420) |   |   |

# (3) Price risk

The Company’s investment portfolio consists of direct and indirect investments in equity instruments classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, which is in line with the Company’s strategy.

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, price fluctuation of marketable equity securities (listed stocks) by 1% would result in changes in other comprehensive income (before income tax) of ~~W76,865 million and ~~W52,510 million, respectively, and changes in profit before tax of ~~W862 million and ~~W3,472 million, respectively.

# (B) Credit risk

Credit risk arises during the normal course of transactions and investing activities where customers or other parties fail to discharge an obligation. The Company monitors and sets the customer’s and counterparty’s credit limit on a periodic basis based on their financial conditions, default history and other factors. Adequate insurance coverage is maintained for trade receivables related to trading partners situated in higher risk countries.

Credit risk can arise from transactions with financial institutions including financial instrument transactions such as cash and cash equivalents, deposits, and derivative instruments. To minimize such risk, the Company transacts only with banks that have a strong international credit rating (S&#x26;P A and above), and new transactions with financial institutions which the Company does not have an existing relationship are subject to the completion of risk assessments prior to commencement of transactions. The Company generally enters into financial agreements without restrictions, such as debt ratio covenants, provision of collateral and/or repayment of loans/borrowings, and otherwise separate approvals are obtained.

The carrying amount of the Company’s financial assets is net of impairment losses and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk equals the carrying amount of its financial assets.

# (C)  Liquidity risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that a company will have difficulty in meeting all its financial obligations. The Company’s main sources of liquidity are cash generated from operations and funds raised from the capital markets and financial institutions, while its main liquidity needs are for investments in production, research and development, working capital and dividends. Due to the nature of the Company’s business, which involves large investments, maintaining adequate levels of liquidity is critical. The Company maintains and manages adequate liquidity through forecasting periodic cash flows, estimating required cash levels, and monitoring inflows and outflows of cash.

The Company has established Cash Pooling by region to respond effectively to liquidity risks, even when individual companies within a region are underfunded. Cash Pooling is a system that shares funds between underfunded and overfunded companies, minimizing the liquidity risk of individual companies, easing the burden of fund management, and reducing financial costs.

In addition, the Company has secured credit lines for its overseas subsidiaries by means of payment guarantees from the head office in the event of large liquidity needs, and, at the end of the period, the Company had investment grade ratings of Aa2 from Moody’s and AA- from S&#x26;P, enabling it to raise funds on the capital market in a timely manner.

# As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the maturity analysis of financial liabilities, based on the remaining period from the reporting date to the contractual maturity date, is as follows:

| December 31, 2024           | Less than 3 months | \~ 6 months | \~1 year  | 1 \~ 5 years | 5 years   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| (In millions of Korean won) | 55,955,211         | 1,369,038   | 1,890,467 | 7,659,645    | 1,993,483 |

| December 31, 2023           | Less than 3 months | \~ 6 months | \~1 year  | 1 \~ 5 years | 5 years   |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ | ----------- | --------- | ------------ | --------- |
| (In millions of Korean won) | 43,302,421         | 589,743     | 1,529,785 | 7,811,246    | 2,337,792 |

The cash flows included in the maturity classification, based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date, are undiscounted expected cash outflows.

The Company’s derivative financial liabilities of ~~W36,795 million (December 31, 2023: ~~W44,252 million) has been included within the less than 3 months bucket. These are the Company’s trading portfolio of derivative instruments, on a net settlement term, of which the contractual maturities are not essential for understanding its cash flows. These contracts are managed on a net fair value basis rather than by the maturity date. Net settled derivatives consist of forwards on currency rates used by the Company to manage the exchange rate profile.

Derivatives that are settled on a gross basis by the delivery of underlying items, including derivatives for hedging, will be settled within the next 35 months from the end of the reporting period. These derivatives are not included in the table above.

Under supplier finance arrangement with a bank, a supplier which provided goods or services to the Company may elect to receive early payment of their invoices from and the bank and the Company repays the bank on the payment due date. The principal purpose of this arrangement is to facilitate efficient payment processing and provide willing suppliers early payment terms. The Company does not derecognize the original trade or other payables relating to the arrangement because neither a legal release was obtained nor was the original liability substantially modified.

# The levels of the fair value hierarchy and its application to financial assets and liabilities are described below.

Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly

Level 3: Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)

The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the reporting date. A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm’s length basis. These instruments are included in Level 1. The instruments included in Level 1 are listed equity investments, most of which are classified as financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income.

# NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximize the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on entity-specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to measure the fair value of an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in Level 2.

If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in Level 3.

The Company performs the fair value measurements required for financial reporting purposes, including Level 3 fair values, and discusses valuation processes and results in line with the financial reporting timelines. The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers between levels at the end of the reporting period if corresponding events or changes in circumstances have occurred.

Specific valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include:

- Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments
- The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the reporting date, with the resulting value discounted to present value
- Other techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, binomial distribution model, etcetera, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments. For trade and other receivables that are classified as current assets, the book value approximates a reasonable estimate of fair value.

# (3) Valuation technique and the inputs

The Company utilizes a present value technique to discount future cash flows using proper interest rates for corporate bonds, government and public bonds, and bank debentures that are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

The following table presents the valuation technique and the inputs used for major financial instruments classified as Level 3 as of December 31, 2024.

Sensitivity analysis of financial instruments is performed to measure favorable and unfavorable changes in the fair value of financial instruments which are affected by the unobservable parameters, using a statistical technique. When the fair value is affected by more than two input parameters, the amounts represent the most favorable or unfavorable.

The results of the sensitivity analysis for effect on income or loss before tax from changes in inputs for major financial instruments which are categorized within Level 3 and subject to sensitivity analysis are as follows:

| (In millions of Korean won)                                                   | Favorable changes |         | Unfavorable changes |           |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| Classification                                                                | Profit or loss    | Equity  | Profit or loss      | Equity    |
| Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (loss)(\*1) | -                 | 207,262 | -                   | (134,940) |
| Other (\*2)                                                                   | 144,566           | -       | (131,073)           | -         |

(*1) For equity securities, changes in fair value are calculated by increasing or decreasing perpetual growth rate and weighted average cost of capital (-1.0%~1.0%), which are significant unobservable inputs.

(*2) Changes in fair value were calculated by increasing or decreasing underlying asset price (20%) and price volatility (10%), which are significant unobservable inputs.
