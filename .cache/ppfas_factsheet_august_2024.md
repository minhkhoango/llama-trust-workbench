# About Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (Please visit Page 2)

Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund (PPFCF) is an open ended equity oriented scheme with flexibility to invest a minimum of 65% in Indian equities and up to 35% in overseas equity security and domestic debt / money market securities. The core portfolio consists of equity investments made with a long term outlook and the factors considered while investing are quality of management, quality of the sector and the business (return on capital, entry barriers, capital intensity, use of debt, growth prospects etc) and the valuation of the companies. The endeavor of the fund management team is to identify opportunities for long term investments. However, there are times when the opportunities are not attractive enough. While waiting for attractive opportunities, the fund invests in arbitrage opportunities between the cash and futures equity markets and special situations arbitrage where open offers / delisting / merger events have been announced. Investments are also made in money market / debt securities while waiting for deployment in core equity investments.

# Outlook

We continue to look at individual investments on their own merits and will not hesitate to invest if an opportunity looks attractive. As usual, our investment stance does not depend much on the macro-economic situation but is focussed on individual companies. We have about 17.59% in cash holdings, debt &#x26; money market instruments and arbitrage positions which can be deployed in long term investments at appropriate levels.

Parag Parikh ELSS

# Tax Saver Fund

# India-centric Scheme

Suitable for long-term capital appreciation

An open-ended equity linked saving scheme with a statutory lock in of 3 years and tax benefit.

# Parag Parikh ELSS Tax Saver Fund

# India-centric Scheme

- At least 80% of the Parag Parikh ELSS Tax Saver Fund's corpus will be invested in Indian equities.
- It has the freedom to:
- Invest in stocks of small, medium and large-sized Companies based in India.
- Invest in any sector or industry within India which appears to be attractively valued.
- Participate in buy-backs and other special situations within India.

# About the Scheme...

It is an open-ended Equity Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) with a statutory lock-in of 3 years and tax benefit from the date of investment for every investment instalment.

Indian investors who opt for old regime of income tax and invest in this Scheme are eligible for Income Tax deduction u/s 80C upto a sum of Rs. 1.50 lakhs^. However, this is not a ceiling. Amounts beyond that can also be invested in the Scheme.

While the income tax relief is certainly beneficial to many, the Scheme's other attributes mean that it could also be attractive to those who have exhausted this limit.

Also, we have always maintained that equity investments are best suited for investors who can remain invested for at least five years. The three year lock-in in Parag Parikh ELSS Tax Saver Fund is much lower than this, and therefore should not deter you.

It enjoys the same Capital Gains Tax benefits as available to other equity oriented schemes (viz. Gains will be taxed at a flat rate of 12.50%*)

*As per Income Tax Rules prevailing for the Financial Year 2024-25

^Please consult your financial advisor for any tax related information applicable to your investments.

Parag Parikh Dynamic Asset Allocation Fund

# An open-ended dynamic asset allocation fund

| Type of Instruments                                                                             | Normal Allocation (% of Net Assets) | Risk Profile    |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Equities & Equity related instruments                                                           | 0-100                               | Very High       |
| Debt securities & Money Market instruments including Units of Debt oriented mutual fund schemes | 0-100                               | Low to Moderate |

The fund will predominantly invest in debt instruments and endeavour to maintain equity allocation between 35% and 65% (some of it will be hedged via approved derivative instruments as permitted by SEBI from time to time).

Entry Load: Not Applicable

Exit Load: In respect of each purchase / switch-in of Units, 10% of the units (“the limit”) may be redeemed without any exit load from the date of allotment.

Any redemption or switch-out in excess of the limit shall be subject to the following exit load:

- Exit load of 1.00% is payable if Units are redeemed / switched-out within 1 year from the date of allotment of units.
- No Exit Load is payable if Units are redeemed / switched-out after 1 year from the date of allotment.

Any exit load charged (net off GST, if any) shall be credited back to the Scheme.

# Key Features of our Investment Strategy:

# Fixed Income Investments

- A relatively wide mandate permits us to include both, 'accrual' and 'duration' related instruments in our portfolio.
- We will retain the flexibility to invest in the entire range of debt securities - Sovereign, State Government, PSU and corporate securities across all maturities - (including securitised debt) and money market instruments.
- Investment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook.

# ~~Equity Investments~~

- Focus on choosing stocks possessing a ‘margin-of-safety’
- Preference for stocks with strong cash flows (higher Income Distribution cum capital withdrawal payout/buybacks)
- Avail of 'special situations' as well as arbitrage opportunities, whenever they arise

# ~~Taxation~~

Investors should be aware that the fiscal rules/ tax laws may change and there can be no guarantee that the current tax position may continue indefinitely. In view of the individual nature of tax implications, investors are advised to consult their professional tax advisor.

The NAV or the net asset value is the total asset value per unit of the mutual fund after deducting all related and permissible expenses. The NAV is calculated at the end of every business day. It is the value at which the investor enters or exits the mutual fund.

# Benchmark

A group of securities, usually a market index whose performance is used as a standard or benchmark to measure investment performance of mutual funds, among other investments. Some typical benchmark include the Nifty, Sensex, BSE 200, BSE 500, 10-year Gsec.

# Entry Load

A mutual fund may have a sales charge or load at the time of entry and/or exit to compensate the distributor/agent. Entry load is charged at the time an investor purchase the units of a mutual fund. The entry load is added to the prevailing NAV at the time of investment. For instance, if the NAV is Rs.100 and the entry load is 1%, the investor will enter the fund at Rs 101.

# Exit Load

Exit load is charged at the time of redeeming (or transferring an investment between schemes). The exit load percentage is deducted from the NAV at the time of redemption (or transfer between schemes). This amount goes to the respective scheme and gets added to the AUM of that Scheme.

# Standard Deviation

Standard deviation is a statistical measure of the range of an investment’s performance. When a mutual fund Scheme has a high standard deviation, its range of performance is wide implying greater volatility.

# Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio named after its founder, the Nobel Laureate William Sharpe is a measure of risk-adjusted returns. It is calculated using standard deviation and excess return to determine reward per unit of risk.

# Beta

Beta is a measure of an investment's volatility vis-a-vis the market. Beta of less than 1 means that the security will be less volatile than the market. A beta of greater than 1 implies that the security's price will be more volatile than the market.

# AUM

AUM or assets under management refers to the recent / updated cumulative market value of investments managed by a mutual fund or any investment firm.

# Holdings

The holding or the portfolio is a mutual fund's latest or updated reported statement of investments/securities. These are usually displayed in term of percentage to net assets or the rupee value or both. The objective is to give investors an idea of where their money is being invested by the fund manager.

# Nature of Scheme

The investment objective and underlying investments determine the nature of the mutual fund scheme. For instance a mutual fund that aims at generating capital appreciation by investing in stock markets is an equity fund or growth fund. Likewise a mutual fund that aims at capital preservation by investing in debt markets is a debt fund or income fund. Each of these categories may have sub-categories.

# Portfolio Turnover Ratio

A measure of how frequently assets within a fund are bought and sold by the managers. Portfolio turnover is calculated by taking either the total amount of new securities purchased or the amount of securities sold - whichever is less - over a particular period, divided by the total net asset value (NAV) of the fund. The measurement is usually reported for a 12-month time period.

# Yield to Maturity (YTM)

The yield to maturity (YTM) of a bond or other fixed-interest security, such as gilts, is the (theoretical) internal rate of return (IRR, overall interest rate) earned by an investor who buys the bond today at the market price, assuming that the bond is held until maturity, and that all coupon and principal payments are made on schedule.

# Modified Duration

Modified duration is a formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates. Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions.

# Total Expense ratio

The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total cost of a fund to the investor. Total costs may include various fees (purchase, redemption, auditing) and other expenses. The TER, calculated by dividing the total annual cost by the fund's total assets averaged over that year, is denoted as a percentage.

# Derivative

Derivative includes (i) a security derived from a debt instrument, share, loan whether secured or unsecured, risk instrument or contract for differences or any other form of security; (ii) a contract which derives its value from the prices, or index of prices, or underlying securities.
